The river flows beneath the glowing moon and the stars.
Clouds drift above the mountain, touching the sky.
A quiet forest rests near the edge of the ocean.
Sunlight dances on the surface of the earth and the river.
The mountain rises tall, piercing through the cloudy sky.
Birds soar high above the blue ocean under the golden sun.
Stars twinkle softly over the calm, quiet forest.
The river winds through valleys beneath the bright sun.
Clouds gather over the horizon, casting shadows on the forest.
The sky stretches endlessly, connecting the earth to the stars.
